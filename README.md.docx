# Supercharger-Finder
Uses Google maps to find nearby Tesla Superchargers. Uses Google Maps API and Open ChargeMapAPI. 


HTML, CSS, and Javascript. 


I fed the Google Map geocode into OpenChargeMap API and scrapped specific parameters.
Typescript did not like the .google types used in Google APIs
